# Mental Health Support Chatbot ðŸ’™

## Overview

This project is a **Mental Health Support Chatbot**, built to provide temporary, supportive advice for individuals experiencing challenges like stress, anxiety, depression, and more. The chatbot employs **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface and uses the **LLaMA 2 model** for generating responses based on selected concerns and tones.

The primary purpose of this application is to offer **comforting and practical advice** to users, while emphasizing that it is not a substitute for professional help. It showcases how I can set up a basic mental health chatbot using **LLMs (Large Language Models)** on a web-based platform. 

This project is inspired by the tutorial video by **Krish Naik** ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMJWC-csdK4)) and has been customized to enhance its functionality and educational value.

## Key Features

### 1. **User-Friendly Interface**
The application uses **Streamlit** to create a simple, visually appealing interface that allows users to:
- Select the mental health challenges they are experiencing (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts).
- Choose the tone of the response (Calm, Empathetic, or Uplifting).
- Receive a comforting message tailored to their inputs.

### 2. **Customizable Tone and Issues**
- The chatbot generates messages that adapt to the user's chosen tone, ensuring empathetic and appropriate responses.
- Users can select multiple challenges, and the chatbot generates advice addressing all selected issues.

### 3. **Disclaimer for Safety**
- A visible **disclaimer** emphasizes that the chatbot is not a replacement for therapy or medical care and encourages users to consult a licensed professional if needed.

### 4. **LLaMA 2 Integration**
The project uses the **LLaMA 2 model (7B-parameter variant)** for generating natural, empathetic responses.

## Limitations

### 1. **Not a Replacement for Therapy**
This chatbot is designed to provide temporary support and encouragement but is **not intended to diagnose or treat mental health conditions**. Its purpose is educational, demonstrating how LLMs can be leveraged in sensitive applications.

### 2. **Hardware Limitations**
The LLaMA 2 model is computationally intensive. Due to my laptop's **limited hardware (insufficient RAM and GPU resources)**, I am unable to run this code locally. However, it has been tested on compatible hardware setups, such as **cloud-based environments** or systems with higher RAM and GPU capabilities.

### 3. **Still Learning**
As I continue my journey into LLMs, this project reflects my **beginner-level understanding** of large language models and chatbot development. With time and experience, I plan to enhance this application further, exploring deployment options like **Hugging Face Spaces**, **AWS**, or **Google Colab** for running the model efficiently.

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (for UI)
- **Backend:** LLaMA 2 (7B Chat variant) via the `langchain_community.llms` and `CTransformers` libraries.
- **Model:** [Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin) (quantized for efficient usage).

### How It Works
1. **User Input:** Users select mental health issues they are facing and their preferred tone for the response.
2. **Prompt Generation:** A dynamically generated prompt combines the user's inputs and is passed to the LLaMA 2 model.
3. **Response:** The model generates a comforting message tailored to the user's concerns and tone.
4. **Output:** The response is displayed on the Streamlit interface for the user.

## Future Enhancements

- **Deploy on Cloud Platforms:** Implement on cloud services like AWS or Google Colab for live testing and broader accessibility.
- **Add More Options:** Include additional tones and mental health issues for greater personalization.
- **Resource Optimization:** Explore model quantization or other LLMs with lower hardware requirements.
- **Language Support:** Extend support for multiple languages to reach a global audience.
